## 🎯 Phase 2: Professional Website with Analytics (Next)

**Goal**: Build a professional website with proper analytics tracking

**Why**:
- Streamlit is for data apps, not websites
- Need to track user behavior and engagement
- Maintain Python-only stack
- Keep deployment simple and cheap
- Full control over design and user experience

**Framework: FastAPI + Jinja2 (Recommended)**

### Why FastAPI + Jinja2?

  - Easy to learn (Python + HTML)
  - Async by default (excellent performance)
  - Perfect for company websites
- **Cons**:
  - Need to write HTML/CSS (not a con if you want professional look)
  - More code than Streamlit
- **Cost**: Free (self-hosted)
- **Hosting**: DigitalOcean App Platform ($5-12/month)

### Alternative: Django
- **Pros**:
  - All-in-one framework
  - Built-in admin panel
  - ORM for database
  - Very professional
- **Cons**:
  - Heavier/more complex
  - Overkill for simple sites
  - Steeper learning curve
- **Best For**: Large, complex websites

**Implementation Checklist**:
- [ ] Set up FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Create HTML templates (base, home, companies, company-detail)
- [ ] Migrate data loading and filtering logic
- [ ] Create professional CSS styling
- [ ] Implement company search and filtering
- [ ] Add interactive features (if needed)
- [ ] Implement analytics (Google Analytics 4)
- [ ] Set up custom domain routing
- [ ] Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform
- [ ] Test all features work correctly
- [ ] Monitor performance and user engagement
